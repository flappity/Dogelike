Just learning python and libtcod simultaneously. Will slowly evolve into the game I want it to be. Unfortunately, I have no idea what that might be.

So far my vision is inspired by Valhalla/Ragnarok, Ultima Online to an extent, more than likely DCSS as it's what I have been playing most recently, and Brogue I think.

Nothing is concrete yet, all names/spells/etc exist right now simply to ensure that stuff is working as I build the core engine.

My plan is to have an Elona-style overworld map, with pre-placed towns and some dungeons, alongside procedurally generated dungeons per playthrough.  I'm not sure of the setting, but possibilities include generic fantasy, or a steampunk or Arcanum sort of setting.  I thought about trying a futuristic sort of thing, but I don't think I'd enjoy it as much. Maybe another project could fit into that setting, though.
